    description: "The Fisker Ocean is an all-electric SUV that represents the rebirth of the Fisker brand under founder Henrik Fisker after the original company's bankruptcy in 2013. Built on a dedicated EV platform developed in collaboration with Magna Steyr (who also manufactures the vehicle in Austria), it features distinctive styling that balances aerodynamic efficiency with traditional SUV proportions. The exterior design incorporates several innovative elements including a solar roof that can add up to 1,500 miles of range annually in optimal conditions, a 'California Mode' that opens all windows and the roof with a single touch, and a unique rear window that can be lowered to accommodate long items. Available in various trim levels including Sport, Ultra, and Extreme, the powertrain options range from a single-motor front-wheel drive setup producing 275 HP in the base model to a dual-motor all-wheel drive system delivering up to 564 HP in the Extreme variant. Battery capacity also varies by model, with the larger 106 kWh pack in higher trims providing an EPA-estimated range of up to 360 miles. The interior features a minimalist design focused on sustainability, using recycled materials including plastics recovered from the ocean. Technology highlights include a massive 17.1-inch central touchscreen that can rotate between portrait and landscape orientations, a digital instrument display, and comprehensive driver assistance systems. The Ocean represents Fisker's vision for sustainable mobility, combining performance, technology, and environmental consciousness in a package designed to compete with established premium electric SUVs."
